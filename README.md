A person can create a flower bouquet with either 3 roses (cost of bouquet = p) or 1 rose and 1 lily (cost = q)
In an array of flowers, the person has to select contiguous set of flowers i.e. 2 or 3 to gain maximum cost.

Input format: A string of 0(denotes rose) and 1(denotes lily).
Output : Maximum cost.

Examples:
